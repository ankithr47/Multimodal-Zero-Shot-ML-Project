The ThingsEEG-Text dataset is a comprehensive resource designed for studying the relationship between brain activity and natural language processing. It includes EEG data recorded from participants viewing object images (from the Things dataset), along with corresponding textual descriptions. The dataset aims to explore the connection between visual perception and language processing, specifically focusing on how semantic representations of objects can be decoded from brain activity. With EEG recordings from multiple participants and a diverse range of images paired with text descriptions, ThingsEEG-Text serves as a valuable resource for research in multimodal cognitive neuroscience, helping to understand neural and semantic processes during object perception.\n"

        "- Figure X shows the variance distribution across flattened EEG features (17 channels × 33 timepoints). Variance is highly non-uniform, with several channel–timepoint combinations exhibiting substantially larger variability across trials. This indicates that discriminative information is temporally and spatially localised, rather than uniformly distributed. At the same time, the presence of high-variance features motivates feature standardisation and regularised linear baselines to prevent dominance by noisy components."

Be aware that the memory usage<br>  of this solver has a quadratic dependency on `n_features * n_classes`<br>  because it explicitly computes the full Hessian matrix.<br>- For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'<br>  and 'saga' are faster for large ones;<br>- 'liblinear' can only handle binary classification by default. To apply a<br>  one-versus-rest scheme for the multiclass setting one can wrap it with the<br>  :class:`~sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`.<br><br>.. warning::<br>   The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen (`l1_ratio=0`<br>   for L2-penalty, `l1_ratio=1` for L1-penalty and `0 < l1_ratio < 1` for<br>   Elastic-Net) and on (multinomial) multiclass support:<br><br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   solver            l1_ratio                 multinomial multiclass<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br>   'lbfgs'           l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'liblinear'       l1_ratio=1 or l1_ratio=0 no<br>   'newton-cg'       l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'newton-cholesky' l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'sag'             l1_ratio=0               yes<br>   'saga'            0<=l1_ratio<=1           yes<br>   ================= ======================== ======================<br><br>.. note::<br>   'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features<br>   with approximately the same scale.

        "### • **Defining the Neural Network (`BrainModel`)**:\n",
        "   - The model consists of four fully connected layers:\n",
        "     - **Input layer**: Takes in the number of features from the brain data.\n",
        "     - **Three hidden layers**: Each layer applies a linear transformation followed by the ReLU activation function, with 256, 128, and 64 neurons respectively.\n",
        "     - **Output layer**: Maps the hidden layer output to the number of classes (50 in this case) without any activation function, as `CrossEntropyLoss` handles the logits.\n",
        "   - **Activation function**: ReLU is applied to the hidden layers to introduce non-linearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "### • **Training the Model**:\n",
        "   - **`train_model()` function**:\n",
        "     - The model is trained for a specified number of epochs (1000 in this case).\n",
        "     - The training process involves forward propagation, loss computation using `CrossEntropyLoss`, and backpropagation to update the model parameters with the Adam optimizer.\n",
        "     - After each epoch, the loss is printed, allowing tracking of the model's progress.\n",
        "\n",
        "### • **Testing the Model**:\n",
        "   - **`test_model()` function**:\n",
        "     - During evaluation, the model is set to evaluation mode (`model.eval()`), and no gradients are computed.\n",
        "     - The model predicts the top 5 class labels for each test sample using `torch.topk()`.\n",
        "     - The **Top-1 Accuracy** (whether the top predicted label matches the true label) and **Top-5 Accuracy** (whether the true label is among the top 5 predictions) are calculated and printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### • **Data Preparation**:\n",
        "   - The training and testing data are converted to `float` type, while labels are converted to `long` integers, which is required by PyTorch.\n",
        "   - The labels are also adjusted by subtracting 1 to ensure they range from 0 to 49, as PyTorch expects zero-based indexing for class labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "### • **Model Initialization**:\n",
        "   - A `BrainModel` is initialized with 50 output classes (for classification) and the number of features from the brain data.\n",
        "   - The Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of `0.001`, and `CrossEntropyLoss` is used as the loss function for this multi-class classification task.\n",
